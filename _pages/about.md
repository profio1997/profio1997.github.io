TL;DR: Customer-oriented technology professional with 10 years’ experience building and scaling innovative solutions at the intersection of computational neuroscience, biomedical informatics and AI/ML architecture.

Customer-oriented <a href='#'>AI/ML Program & Product Manager</a> with a proven track record of building and scaling innovative technical solutions that deliver measurable impact.   With extensive experience in leading the end-to-end product lifecycle, I specialize in leveraging AI/ML, user-centered design, and iterative methods to build high-quality products that align business goals with user needs.   At Komatsu North America, I lead the global planning, integration, and optimization of ServiceNow ITSM, ITOM, and SPM platforms – partnering with AI/ML teams to drive innovation and deliver measurable uptime, cost-reduction, and productivity gains to over 10,000 users globally. Key achievements include developing the roadmap and delivery strategy for UW Health’s AI/ML initiative – which automated clinical workflows to reduce costs and clinician burnout while enhancing user experience; leading an AI/ML research initiative for Workday that identified 8 strategic partnerships to reduce costs, mitigate enterprise risk, and enhance the user experience for 70M+ users globally; building and scaling a SaaS eCommerce platform that redefined how creators expand their reach and monetize their artwork through A/B testing, user feedback, and analytics to increase customer retention; co-leading the global development and launch of 2 pharmaceutical products with a $20M+ budget, boosting client market share and improving ophthalmology patient outcomes; and advancing cardiovascular medicine by developing regenerative medicine products in collaboration with a global research team of 18 associates, co-authoring literature cited by 30+ academic and industry organizations including the American Heart Association.   My superpower is translating technical ideas into actionable product requirements, enabling engineering teams to build the right solutions while bring cross-functional teams along the way, so that we all get smarter.
